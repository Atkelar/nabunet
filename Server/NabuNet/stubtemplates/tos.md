# Terms of Service

## Overview

The server is provided "as is", without a fee and without any obligation. That being said, use of the Server is governed by these terms.

## Services

The server is specifically geared to provide a way of hosting and connectivity for the Nabu PC platform. This includes software and articles/posts and messages.

## Rules

The users of the server are responsible for following established law and are liable for anything they put towards the server including but not limited to uploaded software and posted content.

## Age limits / Adults only please

Since the presence of minors is a legal minefield, the operator of this server has elected to only allow persons of 18 years and older.
Should the legal age of adulthood be higher than 18 in your place of residence, that higher age applies!

## Content Policy

Content uploaded and provided on this server must adhere to valid laws of course. We are no "law free zone" here. This includes but is not limited to:

 * Copyright - only put content to the server where you HAVE the publishing rights!
 * Illegal material - generally some content might be illegal in countries: we do not host **any** form of "adult entertainment" and/or "alternative facts".
 * Harassment - we are not tolerating any form of harassment, online or otherwise.

It is the server operators/moderators responsibility to make a decicion about these rules; It is impossible to write anything that might be considered illegal in a list, but we will take care of any reported issue and will ban repeat or serious offenders, no exception!

## Be kind...

...and ejoy yourself!
